"description" : "Compiled by former curator Eric Curtis, this is a visual and historical celebration, richly illustrated with colour photos throughout.\n\n2006 saw the inauguration of the renovated Kibble Place glasshouse and many other features to take the Gardens into a new century.\n\nGlasgow University first established a Physic Garden in 1706. Changing uses and demands in the plant world and in the wider society in the three hundred years since then have brought about many changes. But the core purpose \"the named collection of plants\" has remained.\n\nAt the point of the three hundredth anniversary of the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, the site is an oasis in the city much used for the enjoyment of the general public. Its botanical base is kept however in the plant collections throughout the eleven acre site.",

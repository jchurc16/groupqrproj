Changing uses and demands in the plant world and in the wider society in the three hundred years since then have brought about many changes. But the core purpose \"the named collection of plants\" has remained.\n\nAt the point of the three hundredth anniversary of the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, the site is an oasis in the city much used for the enjoyment of the general public. Its botanical base is kept however in the plant collections throughout the eleven acre site.",

Of international significance among 19th century curvilinear iron glasshouses, it is a familiar and loved local landmark. But it was not even originally built on its present site. Eric Curtis, former curator of the Botanic Gardens, has researched the life of Glasgow entrepreneur and eccentric John Kibble and his elegant Palace.",
